📘 C Programming Practice Programs

This repository contains basic C programs that help in understanding loops, functions, conditionals, pointers, and pattern printing.
Each program includes sample input and output for better understanding.

🔹 1. Factorial of a Number
📌 Description

This program calculates the factorial of a given integer using a for loop.
It also checks for negative numbers.
=>code:
#include<stdio.h>

int main(){

int num;
 int factorial =1;

printf("enter your int:");
scanf("%d",&num);

if(num<0){
    printf("factorial is not defined for negative number");
}else{
    for(int i=1;i<=num;i++){
       factorial=factorial*i;
    }
     printf("factorial of %d=%d",num,factorial);
}

return 0;

}


⌨️ Input
Enter your int: 5

🖥️ Output
factorial of 5 = 120


If input is negative:

factorial is not defined for negative number

🔹 2. Count Vowels in a Sentence (Using Function)
📌 Description

This program reads a sentence from the user and counts the occurrences of vowels
(A, E, I, O, U) using a user-defined function.





⌨️ Input
Enter a sentence: Hello World

🖥️ Output
A = 0
E = 1
I = 0
O = 2
U = 0

🔹 3. Swap Two Numbers Using Pointers
📌 Description

This program swaps two numbers using call by reference with pointers.






⌨️ Input
Enter two numbers:
10 20

🖥️ Output
After swapping:
x = 20, y = 10



🔹 4. Leap Year Checker (Using Function)
📌 Description

This program checks whether a given year is a Leap Year using a function.








⌨️ Input
Enter a year: 2024

🖥️ Output
2024 is a Leap Year


Example of non-leap year:

2023 is Not a Leap Year

🔹 5. Star Pyramid Pattern
